# =============================================================================#                            VARIABLE DESCRIPTION:# =============================================================================# =============================================================================#                    ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL GOVERNANCE (ESG):# =============================================================================# Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing refers to a set of # standards for a company’s behavior used by socially conscious investors to # screen potential investments. Environmental criteria consider how a company # safeguards the environment, including corporate policies addressing climate # change, for example. Social criteria examine how it manages relationships # with employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities where it operates. # Governance deals with a company’s leadership, executive pay, audits, internal # controls, and shareholder rights.# =============================================================================#                            CORPOARATE GOVERNANCE:# =============================================================================# Corporate governance is the system of rules, practices, and processes by # which a firm is directed and controlled. Corporate governance essentially # involves balancing the interests of a company's many stakeholders, such as # shareholders, senior management executives, customers, suppliers, financiers, # the government, and the community. Since corporate governance provides the # framework for attaining a company's objectives, it encompasses practically # every sphere of management, from action plans and internal controls to # performance measurement and corporate disclosure.# =============================================================================    # =============================================================================#                            RETURN ON EQUITY (ROE):# =============================================================================# Return on equity (ROE) is a measure of financial performance calculated by# dividing net income by shareholders' equity. Because shareholders' equity is # equal to a company’s assets minus its debt, ROE is considered the return on # net assets. ROE is considered a gauge of a corporation's profitability and # how efficient it is in generating profits. The higher the ROE, the more # efficient a company's management is at generating income and growth from its # equity financing.# =============================================================================#                            FINANCIAL LEVERAGE:# =============================================================================# Financial leverage results from using borrowed capital as a funding source # when investing to expand the firm's asset base and generate returns on risk # capital. Leverage is an investment strategy of using borrowed # money—specifically, the use of various financial instruments or borrowed # capital—to increase the potential return of an investment. Leverage can also # refer to the amount of debt a firm uses to finance assets.# =============================================================================#                            BOOK TO MARKET RATIO:# =============================================================================# The book-to-market ratio is one indicator of a company's value. The ratio # compares a firm's book value to its market value. A company's book value is # calculated by looking at the company's historical cost, or accounting value. # A firm's market value is determined by its share price in the stock market # and the number of shares it has outstanding, which is its market # capitalization.# =============================================================================#                            CAPITAL EXPENDITURES:# =============================================================================# Capital expenditures (CapEx) are funds used by a company to acquire, upgrade,  # and maintain physical assets such as property, plants, buildings, technology,#  or  equipment. CapEx is often used to undertake new projects or investments # by a company. Making capital expenditures on fixed assets can include # repairing a roof (if the useful life of the roof is extended), purchasing a # piece of equipment, or building a new factory. This type of financial outlay # is made by companies to increase the scope of their operations or add some # future economic benefit to the operation.# =============================================================================#                                DIVIDENDS:# =============================================================================# A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings to its shareholders # and is determined by the company's board of directors. Dividends are often # distributed quarterly and may be paid out as cash or in the form of # reinvestment in additional stock.# =============================================================================
